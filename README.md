saconvert
=========

saconvert is an R package that facilitates the conversion of stock assessment
(SA) input files from one framework to another. The code started out as a way
to convert International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES)
input files to Age Structured Assessment Program (ASAP) files and
was later augmented to include other frameworks such as 
[Stock Synthesis](https://vlab.ncep.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis) (SS).

To contribute, please issue a pull request or email the 
[package maintainer](mailto:kelli.johnson@noaa.gov).
Feel free to submit an issue if you find an issue with the package or 
if you have a question.
